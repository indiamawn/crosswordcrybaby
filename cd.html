<p>Here is a playlist of some cute and angsty songs for when you have a crush. They're partially inspired by mixtapes that my mom made for my dad in highschool. Speaking of which! I recently went through my personal collection of tapes, which is mostly just ones that my mom made for my dad that survived their multiple moves and my mom's impulsive purging of stuff. They mostly have Bob Dylan on them. <3 </p>
