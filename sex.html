<h1> &nbsp;Sex and the City</h1>
	<p>and I couldn't help but wonder, have I been underestimating the power of a white button up all this time??</p>

<p>While it's incredibly innacurate to the lives of many real women in NYC, it's undeniable that Sex and the City is an iconic show. For me, it's like a hot cup of tea on a cold day. Entirely predictabe and accountable when you're in need of killer 2000's fashion, and it also feels like hanging out with old girl friends.
	
	At the same time, I have a hard time connecting with a lot of the fashion on a person level, even though I love watching it. This is mostly because I don't share the tiny frame and beautiful unruly locks that Carrie Bradshaw has. That being said, I decided to try and put my own spin on two looks from the show.</p>

<p>First was this simple getup. I didn't have a green skirt, but royal blue did the trick.</p>

<p>This one is a bit of a stretch, but since I already had the white button up on, I thought, why not? I definitely would never wear this again, but it was fun for a minute.</p>
